# a function allows us to bundle code into
# reusable blocks, making it easier to manage
# and understand. By defining functions, we can
# avoid code duplication and enhance reliability

# define a function
def problem1():
# calling the function
    pass # I put pass here to avoid syntax error

    # Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
    # Basic Indexing:
    # Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
    # a. Retrieve the 5th character.
    # b. Retrieve the second to last character.
    # c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.

    magic ="'abracadabra"

    print(magic[5])
    print(magic[-2])
    print(magic.index("c"))
